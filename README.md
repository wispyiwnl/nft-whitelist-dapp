# About the proyect

In this project, I launched an NFT collection called _Crypto Devs_, and to ensure that my early supporters had guaranteed access to the NFT mint, I decided to build a whitelist dApp. I developed a feature that allows the first 10 users to join the whitelist for free, giving them exclusive access to mint an NFT from the collection at no cost once it goes live. For users who didnâ€™t make it onto the whitelist, I implemented a paid minting system.


I created 2 smart contracts, one for a whitelist and another for an NFT collection, following the [LearnWeb3](https://learnweb3.io/degrees/ethereum-developer-degree/sophomore/build-an-nft-collection-with-a-whitelist-using-foundry-and-solidity/) tutorial using Foundry. I deployed and verified them on Mode's testnet using this [article](https://dev.to/modenetwork/how-to-deploy-and-verify-a-smart-contract-on-modes-blockchain-using-foundry-2p5n)

```shell
**Whitelist contract:**  0x2e122F4453394791dFd57eB0D28545A04f46c846
**Collection contract:** 0x426Bbd9B8aa1555ba5f5b2Ca7581897d86f5d09E
